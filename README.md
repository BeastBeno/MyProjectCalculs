# ProjectCalculs
This directory is create for a personal projet. 
            The goal is simple represent my school note in a graphique and be able to shows me the number of hours I need to spend per weeks to attend my score I pre-defined .

For this I use Java for the graphic interface and the calcul of the project is made with python.

  The graph.py is the file who contains all the calculs of my projet 
  The Graphics interface file are made with Java swing(I use windows builder for designing the graphic interface)
  
  
A future database will be link with the project in case of multiple users

Note: If you want to test it don't forget to change the path in the file MyUsersInterface.java, AddCourse.java, and in the file graph.py
